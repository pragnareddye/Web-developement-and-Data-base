<ol>
<li><h3>Lion</h3> </li>
<img src="lion.jpg" />
<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the four big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. With some males exceeding 250 kg in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30 to 50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
Lions live for 10 to 14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they scavenge as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are primarily nocturnal, although bordering on crepuscular in nature.

<li><h3>Tiger</h3></li>
<img src="tiger.jpg" />
<p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild. Its most recognisable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard and jaguar. Like all felids, tigers are carnivorous, and primarily prey on ungulates like deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.
Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia. Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by IUCN. The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than 1,184,911 km square(457,497 sq mi), a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s.

<h2> <i>Reptiles </i></h2>
<ol>
<li> <h3> african pancake tortoise </h3></li>
<img src="pancake.jpg" />
<p>The pancake tortoise has an unusually thin, flat, flexible shell, which is up to 17.8 centimetres (7.0 in) long. While the shell bones of most other tortoises are solid, the pancake tortoise has shell bones with many openings, making it lighter and more agile than other tortoises. The carapace (top shell) is brown, frequently with a variable pattern of radiating dark lines on each scute (shell plate), helping to camouflage the tortoise in its natural dry habitat. The plastron (bottom shell) is pale yellow with dark brown seams and light yellow rays, and the head, limbs and tail are yellow-brown. Its bizarre, flattened, pancake-like profile makes this tortoise a sought-after animal in zoological and private collections, leading to its over-exploitation in the wild. 
This East African species is native to southern Kenya and northern and eastern Tanzania, and an introduced population may also occur in Zimbabwe. The species has also been reported in Zambia. It is found on hillsides with rocky outcrops (known as kopjes) in arid thorn scrub and savanna, from 100 to 6,000 feet (30 to 1800 metres) above sea level. The species inhabits the Somalia-Masai floristic region, an arid semi-desert characterized by Acacia-Commiphora bushland and Brachystegia woodland in upland localities. It occurs in dry savannah of low altitude at small rocky hills of the crystalline basement.

<li> <h3>Dwarf Crocodile  </h3> </li>
<img src="dwarf croc.jpg" />
<p>The dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), also known as the African dwarf, broadtosnouted or bony crocodile is an African crocodile. It is also the smallest extant crocodile species in the world. Recent sampling has identified three genetically distinct populations. Some feel that the findings should elevate the subspecies to full species status. Dwarf crocodiles attain a medium adult length of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet), though the maximum recorded length for this species is 1.9 meters (6.2 feet). Adult specimens typically weigh between 18 and 32 kg (40 and 71 lb), with the largest females weighing up to 40 kg (88 lb) and the largest males weighing 80 kg (180 lb). Adults are a uniform black on their backs and sides with a yellowish underside with black patches. Juveniles have a lighter brown banding on body and tails and yellow patterns on the head.
As a result of its small size and heightened vulnerability to predation, this species of crocodile has a heavily armoured neck, back and tail and also has osteoderms on its belly and underside of neck.
Osteolaemus has a blunt short snout, as long as it is wide, similar in fact to that of a dwarf caiman, probably a result of occupying a similar ecological niche. The dentition consists of 4 premaxillary teeth, 12 to 13 on the maxilla and 14 to 15 on the dentary bone.

<h2> <i> Invertebrates</i></h2>
<ol>

<li><h3>Giant African Snail </h3></li>
<img src="images (3).jpg" height="200" width="200" />
<p> Achatina fulica is a species of land snail in the family Achatinidae known commonly as the giant African snail or giant African land snail. It thrives in many types of habitat in areas with mild climates, it feeds voraciously and vectors plant pathogens, causing severe damage to agricultural crops and native plants, it competes with native snail taxa, it is a nuisance pest of urban areas, and it spreads human disease.  It is listed as one of the top 100 invasive species in the world. The adult snail is around 7 centimetres (2.8 in) in height and 20 centimetres (7.9 in) or more in length.
The shell has a conical shape, being about twice as high as it is broad. Either clockwise (dextral) or counter-clockwise (sinistral) directions can be observed in the coiling of the shell, although the right-handed (dextral) cone is the more common. Shell colouration is highly variable, and dependent on diet. Typically, brown is the predominant colour and the shell is banded. The giant African snail is native to East Africa, and can be traced back to Kenya and Tanzania. It is a highly invasive species, and colonies can be formed from a single gravid individual. In many places, release into the wild is illegal. Nonetheless, the species has established itself in some temperate climates and its habitat now includes most regions of the humid tropics, including many Pacific islands, southern and eastern Asia, and the Caribbean. The giant snail can now be found in agricultural areas, coastland, natural forest, planted forests, riparian zones, scrub and shrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.

<li><h3>Rose Hair Tarantula</h3></li>
<img src="tarantula.jpg" />
<p>
The Rose Hair Tarantula (Grammostola rosea), also known in the United States as the Chilean rose tarantula, Chilean flame tarantula, Chilean fire tarantula or the Chilean redtohaired tarantula (depending on the colormorph), is probably the most common species of tarantula available in American and European pet stores today, due to the large number of wildtocaught specimens exported cheaply from their native Chile into the pet trade. The species is also known from Bolivia and Argentina.
G. rosea is a common pet of tarantula hobbyists. Females have been known to live as long as 15 to 20 years, but due to the limited time they have been available on the market (and hence for extensive study) it is possible that they may live considerably longer than 20 years. There is considerable confusion between this species and Grammostola porteri, with some arguing that many of the "G. rosea" in the pet trade (such as the specimen in the taxobox photo to the left) actually are G. porter. Habitat
The G.rosea's natural habitat is the desert and scrub regions of Northern Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina. While previously thought to be wanderers in nature, large numbers have been observed living in burrows in their natural habitat. They generally do not burrow in captivity. They are usually active in the evening or night.
Food
This tarantula has a diverse menu including grasshoppers, crickets, moths, beetles, cockroaches and mealworms. It can also grab hold of a pinky mouse, although this is totally unnecessary and an excellent method of culturing bacteria. When tarantulas are kept as pets, the best food that can be provided for them are crickets that have been gut loaded on vegetables, as this is the best source of hydrated nutrition for the tarantula.

<h2><i>Fish </i></h2>

<ol>
<li><h3>bristlenose catfish</h3></li>
<img src="image1.jpg" height="200" width="200" />
<p>Ancistrus species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth. The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head. Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species. Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout. In comparison with a typical pleco, a bristlenose is typically shorter (4 to 6 inches or 15 cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common. Unlike other plecos which commonly grow to over a foot long, the bristlenose pleco may only grow to half the size, this makes it a suitable species of pleco for the smaller tank.
Ancistrus is one of the widest ranging genera of the family, and representatives are found throughout the range of Loricariidae. Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon Basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as two species, A. centrolepis and A. chagresi in Panama. Three species are true troglobites: A. cryptophthalmus, A. galani and A. formoso. These are the only known loricariids showing adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle with reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.

<li><h3>spotted catfish</h3></li>
<img src="spotted catfish.jpg" />
<p>spotted catfish is a species of catfish. The species is rarely seen. It is hard to tell the sex of the fish until they are an adult. The species can breed easily. The species eat many foods including shrimp pellets, blood worms, brine shrimp, and pretosoaked flake food. Corydoras punctatus is a social fish.

<h2><i>Birds</i></h2>
<ol>
<li><h3> African grey parrot </h3></li>
<img src="grey parrot.jpg" />
<p>The African Grey Parrot is a mediumtosized, predominantly grey, blacktobilled parrot which weighs 400g, with a length of 33 cm and an average wingspan of 46 to 52 cm.The tail and undertail coverts are red, in comparison to the maroon of the smaller Timneh Parrot. Both sexes appear similar. 
The colouration of juveniles similar to that of adults, however the eye is typically dark grey to black, in comparison to the greyish eyes of the adult birds. The undertail coverts are also tinged with grey.
African Grey Parrots are monogamous breeders which nests in tree cavities. The hen lays 3to5 eggs, which she incubates for 30 days while being fed by her mate. Young leave the nest at the age of 12 weeks. Little is known about the courtship behaviour of this species in the wild. 
The African Grey Parrot is primarily a herbivore, feeding on fruit, nuts, leaves, bark and flowers. However it will also eat insects.

<li><h3>Great Grey Owl</h3></li>
<img src="grey owl.jpg" />
<p>The Great Grey Owl or Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa) is a very large owl, documented as the world's largest species of owl, they are distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. In some areas it is also called Phantom of the North Adults have a large, rounded head with a grey face and yellow eyes with darker circles around them. The underparts are light with dark streaks; the upper parts are grey with pale bars. This owl does not have ear tufts and has the largest facial disc of any raptor.
In terms of length, the Great Grey Owl is believed to exceed the Eurasian EagletoOwl and the Blakiston's Fish Owl as the world's largest owl.] The Great Grey is outweighed by those two species as well as several others, including most of the Bubo genus Much of its size is deceptive, since this species' fluffy feathers, large head and the longest tail of any extant owl obscure a body lighter than that of most other large owls. The length ranges from 61 to 84 cm (24 to 33 in), averaging 72 cm (28 in) for females and 67 cm (26 in) for males. The wingspan can exceed 152 cm (60 in), but averages 142 cm (56 in) for females and 140 cm (55 in) for males. The adult weight ranges from 580 to 1,900 g (1.28 to 4.19 lb), averaging 1,290 g (2.84 lb) for females and 1,000 g (2.2 lb) for males.The males are usually smaller than females, as with most owl species.

<h2> <i>Amphibians </i></h2>
<ol>
<li><h3> Vietnamese mossy frog </h3></li>
<img src="mossy frog.jpg" />
<p>The Mossy Frog, Vietnamese Mossy Frog, or Tonkin Bugtoeyed Frog (Theloderma corticale), is a species of frog in the Rhacophoridae family. It is found in Northern Vietnam and possibly China. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and rocky areas. It is a semitoaquatic, semitoarboreal species that is threatened by habitat loss.
The common name of the mossy frog arises from the fact that its skin is a mottled green and brown that resembles moss growing on rock, and forms an effective form of camouflage. They have large sticky pads on their toes and a soft underbelly. As with most Tree Frogs, the females will grow larger than the males and can reach sizes of 7 to 8 cm (3 inches). This species will curl into a ball when frightened, and play dead.
</p>
<li><h3>Tiger salamander </h3></li>
<img src="salamander.png" />
<p>Tiger salamanders grow to a typical length of 6 to 8 in (15 to20 cm) and a maximum of 14 in (36 cm) in length, particularly neotenic individuals. Adults are usually blotchy with grey, green, or black, and have large, lidded eyes. They have short snouts, thick necks, sturdy legs, and long tails. Their diets consist largely of small insects and worms, though it is not rare for an adult to consume small frogs and baby mice.
Adults are rarely seen in the open, and often live in burrows that are usually two feet from the surface. Tiger salamanders are almost entirely terrestrial as adults, and usually only return to the water to breed, but also they partly live in both land and water. Although tiger salamanders are terrestrial, they are good swimmers. Like all ambystomatids, they are extremely loyal to their birthplaces, and will travel long distances to reach them. However, a single tiger salamander has only a 50% chance of breeding more than once in its lifetime. Males nudge a willing female to initiate mating, and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom. The female picks up the packet and deposits the nowtofertilized eggs on vegetation. Largetoscale captive breeding of tiger salamanders has not been accomplished, for unknown reasons.

The larva is entirely aquatic, and is characterized by large external gills and a prominent caudal fin that originates just behind the head. Limbs are fully developed within a short time of hatching. Some larvae, especially in seasonal pools and in the north, may metamorphose as soon as feasible. These are known as small morph adults. Other larvae, especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates, may not metamorphose until fully adult size. These large larvae are usually known as waterdogs, and are used extensively in the fishing bait and pet trade. Some populations may not metamorphose at all, and become sexually mature while in their larval form. These are the neotenes, and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are bad. They are also very hardy.
Although immune themselves, tiger salamanders transmit Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which is a major worldtowide threat to most frog species by causing the disease chytridiomycosis. Tiger salamanders also carry ranaviruses, which infect reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Using tiger salamander larvae as fishing bait appears to be a major source of exposure and transport to wild populations. Severe mortality of tiger salamander larvae sometimes occurs from recurring ranavirus infections.
